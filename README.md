# mlkl
pronounced "em-el-kay-el." a key regulator in the necroptotic pathway.
Mlkl is thought to be the "terminator" protein of the necroptotic pathway. After it is activated by RIPK3, it forms oligomers that translocate to the plasma membrane, forming perforations that culminate with cell death and the release of DAMP signals. Consequently, it is an important regulator in tumors as necroptosis can provoke strong adaptive immune responses. It is important to note that cancer cells generally have a down-regulated expression of Mlkl, which suggests that cancer cells have evolved to "evade" necroptosis for survival. However, in some cancer models, the expression of Mlkl is up-regulated. This contrast in expression across different models indicates the importance of contextualizing necroptotic gene expression for different cancers. In this project, I will be comparing Mlkl expression across different cancer models, which may help elucidate how different cancer cells evade (or do not evade) one form of cell death: necroptosis.
